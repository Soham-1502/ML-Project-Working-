### How It Works

- Uses **Wav2Vec2** transformer models for audio processing.
- Trained on datasets like **RAVDESS**, **TESS**, and gender-specific datasets.
- ML Models used:
  - ðŸŽ¯ Emotion: `Wav2Vec2` (fine-tuned for English speech emotion recognition)
  - ðŸ‘¤ Gender: `Wav2Vec2` (fine-tuned for gender recognition)

---

ðŸ“¦ Accuracy:
- Gender Detection: ~95% (based on model evaluation)
- Emotion Detection: ~85% (based on model evaluation)
